#HOW TO DEPLOY ON TOMCAT SERVER FROM MAVEN

1. spin up different servers for both maven and tomcat 
   Note: Ensure you have a build on maven & if not (mvn package) to build

2. On maven server (inside the maven repo), create a file with the exact name of the security key used to create the tomcat server (eg tomcat.pem),
  open the tomcat security key in notepad, copy the content and paste in the file created in maven repo to LINK the two servers together.

3. On maven server, use this command
  scp -i <name of the created file in 2> target/maven-web-app.war ec2-user@57.13.45.37:/opt/tomcat9/webapps

NOTE: syntax
scp -i <name of the created file in 2> target/maven-<war file> ec2-user@<tomcat server IP>:/opt/tomcat9/webapps

4. Change privilege of the tomcat.pem in 2 to 400:
   chmod 400

5. Use the command on 3 again after changing the privilege

6. Launch your browser, TYPE tomcat server IP:/maven-web-app

7. To hot fix bug--- this is correcting of errors by DevOps in the deployment without waiting for the dev team.
  a. Go to maven server
  b. src -> main -> webapp -> jsps
  c. vi home.jsp        to edit or fix the bug

8. Use the command below to remove old build, and rebuild new artefacts
   mvn clean package

9. To re-deploy, use the command on 3 again
