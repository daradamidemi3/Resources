Oh Lord, I look up to you. Make a way for me this month.


Lord, I cannot find the way without you.

Lord, I cannot walk without you holding my hand.

O LoRD my God, show me unmerit mercy this week.

I am not a prophet, but she brought prophet's gift to me

Lord, favour her and her daughter at the interview today.
