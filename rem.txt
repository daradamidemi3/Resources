I CRY TO YOU LORD

God remember me this month
Lord, you have never failed me.

God remember me this month.
Lord, look down from heaven and show me mercy.
I am weak and weary of this situation.
But I still look unto you beacuse you are my helper and provider.

Your word says "They that trust in YOU shall never be ashamed or confounded"

Unto thee O Lord, 
Do I lift up my soul
Unto thee O Lord, 
Do I lift up my soul
O my God, I trust in Thee
Let me not be ashamed,
And let not my enemies triumph over me.
